# KBA-Monitoring
Contains GEE scripts for monitoring fires, forest loss and nightlights across Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs)

Requires KBA (or other site) boundaries to be uploaded to Google Drive as a Google Fusion Table.

Contact alison.beresford@rspb.org.uk for more information.

Note: I have spotted an error in the FIRMS fire frequency code - will be corrected shortly
